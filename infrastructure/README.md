# Creative Studio Infrastructure

This directory contains the Terraform configuration and infrastructure-as-code definitions for deploying Creative Studio on Google Cloud Platform.

## Database Migrations & Safe Upgrades

When making major changes to the database infrastructure (e.g., migrating from an old Public IP setup to a Private IP setup), Terraform must update network settings. This causes a brief window where the active Cloud Run container can no longer connect to the database, resulting in a startup crash that creates a deadlock for Terraform.

To safely prevent this, the `bootstrap.sh` script employs a smart **Migration Flow**:

1. **Step 8 — Backup.** It safely exports your database to the Terraform state bucket as `migration_backup.sql.gz`.
2. **Step 9 — Sever the link.** It deploys a temporary, database-agnostic "dummy" container (`us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello`) to the Cloud Run backend, completely removing its database dependency.
3. **Step 10 — Apply.** It runs `terraform apply` cleanly without triggering Cloud Run deadlocks.
4. **Step 10 (import) — Restore.** It wipes and recreates the target database, then imports the backup into the newly provisioned instance.
5. **Step 13 — Redeploy.** It triggers Cloud Build to re-deploy your real application code safely.

### How to trigger a Safe Migration

The script employs a hybrid detection mechanism to protect you automatically while keeping the "happy path" silent:

- **Automatic Trigger (V1 Legacy DBs):** If the script detects you are upgrading from an ancient V1 Public IP database (`creative-studio-db` or `creative-studio-db-<hex>`, e.g. `creative-studio-db-6eb3034d`), it automatically pauses and asks if you want to run the migration flow. Answering `n` skips it entirely.
- **Automatic Trigger (Orphaned Backups):** If the script detects a `migration_backup.sql.gz` file sitting in your **Terraform state bucket**, it will ask if you want to restore it using the migration flow. Only that bucket is scanned, because it is the bucket responsible for infrastructure artifacts.
- **Manual Trigger (`--migrate-db`):** If you are intentionally making a dangerous infrastructure change (e.g. changing database regions or network paths manually), you can manually force this safety flow by running:
  ```bash
  ./bootstrap.sh --migrate-db
  ```
  Unlike the automatic triggers, this one intercepts **any** database it finds — public *or* private.
- **Resume from an existing backup (`--use-existing-backup`):** If a previous run already exported the data but `terraform apply` then failed half-way (e.g. the `creative_studio` database was dropped while the instance survived), a new export is impossible. This flag skips the export and runs the migration flow with the `migration_backup.sql.gz` already in the Terraform state bucket:
  ```bash
  ./bootstrap.sh --use-existing-backup
  ```
  Without the flag, if an export fails and that backup exists, the script offers to reuse it instead of aborting.

If you do NOT pass the flag, and the script doesn't detect a legacy database, it assumes a standard "happy path" deployment and relies entirely on Cloud SQL's automated **Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)**. Steps 8, 9 and the import are all no-ops in that case — zero prompts, zero downtime.

> [!CAUTION]
> Immediately before restoring, the script **drops and recreates** the `creative_studio` database on the target instance. This guarantees a blank schema so the import cannot fail with `relation "..." already exists`. Any data written to the new instance before the restore is discarded in favour of the backup.

> [!NOTE]
> The dummy container is deployed to **both** the legacy backend service name (`cstudio-be`) and the current one (`cs-[ENV_NAME]-backend`). Each is checked for existence first, so nothing is created that did not already exist.

> [!TIP]
> The backup file is intentionally left in the bucket after a successful import as a permanent safeguard. Delete `migration_backup.sql.gz`, or pass `--skip-db-import`, to stop being prompted about it on future runs.

## Izumi Agent

`bootstrap.sh` deploys the Izumi agent exactly as upstream ships it: its Vertex AI endpoint, model IDs and `mediagent_kit` defaults are left untouched (the agent runs on the `global` endpoint). The only location the bootstrap sets is where the Agent Engine resource itself is created (`--location=$DEPLOY_REGION`), since reasoning engines must live in a concrete region.


## Troubleshooting

### Manual Database Import
If a migration was interrupted, your data is always safe in your project's Terraform state bucket (`gs://[PROJECT_ID]-terraform-state/migration_backup.sql.gz`). You can manually restore it via the GCP Console or CLI:
```bash
gcloud sql import sql YOUR_NEW_DB_INSTANCE_NAME \
  gs://YOUR_TF_BUCKET_NAME/migration_backup.sql.gz \
  --database="creative_studio" \
  --project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```
