# Step by step guide for DEVs | Local Development of Creative Studio

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up and running the Creative Studio application **on your local machine**. It covers the **standard local development setup using Docker Compose**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)**: For authenticating and managing your GCP resources.
- **Github Account**: If you don't already have a GitHub account.
- **Install Antigravity**: [Download Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)
- **Install Docker and docker compose**: [Download Docker](http://docker.com/get-started/)
- **Install nvm**: [Download nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and then install the latest node version. Version 20 or higher.
- **Install uv**: A fast Python package installer. [Install it here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

## 2. Initial Setup

1.  Go to your GCP Account and make sure you can login.
2.  After you create your account:
    - You create a fork of [Open Source Repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcc-creative-studio/tree/main)
    - You see this video [How to Deploy Creative Studio.mp4](./screenshots/how_to_deploy_creative_studio.mp4) and deploy Creative Studio into your GCP Account environment, using CloudShell for simplicity.
3.  Ensure required Google Cloud APIs are enabled in your project:
    - **Google Drive API**: Ensure `drive.googleapis.com` is enabled in your project via the [Google Cloud Console API Overview](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview) if planning to use media gallery upload from Drive.

## 3. Add env variables to repo where we’ll work

You can connect to your new GCP Argolis Account by setting a `backend/.env` file for the backend and a `frontend/src/environments/development.environment.ts` file for the frontend.

> **Important!!!** set `isLocal = True`, in both frontend and backend, this is so that instead of loggin in with Identity Platform, we login with Firebase, and we keep Identity Platform Authorized Javascript origins clean, without the need to whitelist localhost.

Add the following env variables in your cloned repo “gcc-creative-studio” modifying the corresponding locations, and replacing with your env values:

### `backend/.env` file

```bash
# Common env vars
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:4200"
ENVIRONMENT="local"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Project ID: creative-studio-deploy
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="creative-studio-deploy"
PROJECT_ID="creative-studio-deploy"
GENMEDIA_BUCKET="creative-studio-deploy-cs-development-bucket"
SIGNING_SA_EMAIL="cs-development-read@creative-studio-deploy.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
GOOGLE_TOKEN_AUDIENCE="XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
IDENTITY_PLATFORM_ALLOWED_ORGS=""

# --- Database Configuration (Local Docker Postgres) ---
DB_USER="studio_user"
DB_PASS="studio_pass"
DB_NAME="creative_studio"
DB_HOST="postgres"
DB_PORT="5432"
USE_CLOUD_SQL_AUTH_PROXY=false
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL="your-user-email"
```

> 💡 **Best Practice Tip: Local PostgreSQL Container**
> For local development and testing, we include a lightweight PostgreSQL Docker container to bypass the need for an actual Cloud SQL instance. This delivers key advantages:
>
> - **Zero Costs**: Avoids billing accrual on cloud data lookups during validation work cycles.
> - **Safe Experimentation**: Clear volume bindings locally without risking production states or accidental cloud data drops.
> - **Instant Migrations Validation**: Speed runs Alembic updates completely isolated and offline.

### `frontend/src/environments/development.environment.ts` file

```typescript
export const environment = {
  // Project ID: creative-studio-deploy
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "creative-studio-deploy.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "creative-studio-deploy",
    storageBucket: "creative-studio-deploy.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXX",
  },
  production: false,
  isLocal: true,
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  backendURL: "http://localhost:8080/api",

  // Common env vars
  EMAIL_REGEX:
    /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/,
  ADMIN: "admin",
};
```

## 4. Running with Docker Compose

We use Docker to build and run both the frontend and backend containers, simplifying the setup process.

After installation and before running docker compose, be sure to set your default gcloud login:

```bash
# Set the target project for the deployment
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Set up application-default credentials
gcloud auth application-default login
```

And also to give your account access to presign the urls you’ll get on your frontend:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get project)
export USER_EMAIL=$(gcloud config get account)

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding cs-development-read@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --member="user:$USER_EMAIL" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```

You are all set, from the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### 💡 Seeding Initial Workspaces (Local Development/Testing)

If you are running this locally for the first time or your database is fresh, you might find that the Workspaces list is empty. You should run the bootstrap script once to seed default templates and verify access:

```bash
docker exec -t creative-studio-backend sh -c "PYTHONPATH=/app uv run python -m bootstrap.bootstrap"
```

As this uses volumes, and we use hot reload to start the services, every time you change something on the files the container will be refreshed with the changes.

### 🤖 Running the Izumi Agent locally (Workbench chat)

In the cloud, the Workbench chat talks to the Izumi `ads_x` agent deployed on **Vertex AI Agent Engine**. Locally, with `ENVIRONMENT="local"`, the backend instead targets a **local Izumi container** at `IZUMI_AGENT_URL` (default `http://izumi-agent:8080`), so you can iterate on both projects without deploying anything.

```bash
# 1. Clone upstream Izumi into the repo root (the folder is gitignored)
git clone --depth 1 -b v0.2.1 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/genmedia-izumi-agent.git genmedia-izumi-agent

# 2. Upstream ships no compose file for ads_x: copy our tracked reference files in
cp docs/local-izumi/docker-compose.yml docs/local-izumi/.env.example genmedia-izumi-agent/demos/backend/ads_x/

# 3. Configure and start the agent (+ a Firestore emulator for ADK sessions)
cd genmedia-izumi-agent/demos/backend/ads_x
cp .env.example .env            # GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, ASSET_SERVICE_GCS_BUCKET, ...
docker compose up --build       # first build takes a few minutes
```

> [!NOTE]
> Start Creative Studio first (`docker compose up` at the repo root): the Izumi compose joins its `gcc-creative-studio_default` network so the two backends can reach each other as `http://backend:8080` and `http://izumi-agent:8080`. The agent reuses your host `~/.config/gcloud` ADC for Vertex AI calls.

- Agent API / ADK dev UI on the host: `http://localhost:8082` (`/docs`, `/dev-ui`).
- `demos/backend` and `mediagent_kit` are bind-mounted with `--reload`, so edits to the agent apply live.
- To keep using a deployed Agent Engine from a local backend instead, set `USE_LOCAL_IZUMI_AGENT=false` and `AGENT_ENGINE_RESOURCE_NAME=...` in `backend/.env`.
- The reference `docker-compose.yml` / `.env.example` are versioned in [`docs/local-izumi/`](docs/local-izumi/README.md). If you tweak the copy inside `genmedia-izumi-agent/`, copy it back so the change is tracked.

<details>
<summary><b>Without Docker Compose</b> (plain <code>docker build</code> / <code>docker run</code>)</summary>

The compose file is only a convenience wrapper around upstream's `deployment/Dockerfile`. The same setup with the Docker CLI alone (run from the `genmedia-izumi-agent/` folder, with Creative Studio already up):

```bash
# Build the image (APP_ENV=local makes mediagent_kit use the emulator/local settings)
docker build -f deployment/Dockerfile --build-arg APP_ENV=local -t izumi-ads-x:local .

# Firestore emulator for ADK sessions
docker run -d --name izumi-firestore-emulator --network gcc-creative-studio_default -p 8086:8086 \
  google/cloud-sdk:emulators gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=0.0.0.0:8086

# The agent itself (same env as the compose file; root user to reuse the host ADC mount)
docker run -d --name izumi-agent --network gcc-creative-studio_default -p 8082:8080 --user root \
  --env-file demos/backend/ads_x/.env \
  -e PORT=8080 -e APP_ENV=local -e GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True \
  -e FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=izumi-firestore-emulator:8086 -e FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID= \
  -e USE_CREATIVE_STUDIO=True -e ENABLE_HITL_GATES=True \
  -e GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT=0 -e GRPC_POLL_STRATEGY=poll -e PYTHONPATH=/app \
  -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud:ro" \
  izumi-ads-x:local
```

This runs the code baked into the image (no hot reload). Rebuild the image to pick up agent changes, or add the `demos/backend` / `mediagent_kit` bind mounts from the compose file. Clean up with `docker rm -f izumi-agent izumi-firestore-emulator`.

## 5. Code Quality & Pre-commit Hooks

To maintain code quality and consistency, we use a fully containerized `pre-commit` pipeline. **DO NOT** run linters locally on your host machine.

### Setup Git Hook

Run once from the root of the project:

```bash
cp pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will link the pre-commit hook to your git workflow. Now, every time you commit, the hooks will run automatically inside a Docker container.

### Manual Run

To format and lint the **entire repository** at once:

```bash
docker compose run --rm pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Linters Used

- **Backend**: `black` (formatting), `pylint` (linting).
- **Frontend**: `gts` (ESLint + Prettier).
- **License**: `addlicense` (adds headers).
